Procedure:

We checked the C code for holes and we found 2:

* The common name parser stops at the next '/' character
* The comparison is a string comparison

-> This means that we can use the URLs:
  * data.gov-of-caltopia.info/.neocal.info
  * data.gov-of-caltopia.info\x00.neocal.info

We generated a private key and a Certificate Request with it for
CN=lolwhocares.neocal.info
and made two files with the URLs above.
We inputted the files into the rewriter and put it into the CA website.

Copy-paste the results into .x509 files, and loaded them (with the privkey file)
into sslsniff.

In rewriter.py, print the http_request.
