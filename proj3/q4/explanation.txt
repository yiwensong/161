To obtain the secret, I used the DigiPwntar CA certificate to sign a
certificate signing request I created for the email.gov-of-caltopia.info
domain. Then I used the scapy script to inject a fake DNS response for
email.gov-of-caltopia.info, redirecting it to the localhost whenever
the Governor's PC queried it. This local web server is able to use the
private keys and serve fake responses that the Chromium browser will
accept as secure. Then, when the governor sends his password data,
we can capture his password.

There are two ways the Governor could have prevented this attack.
The first is to use DNSSEC to create a chain of trust for the DNS
query, so we are unable to spoof it without convincing the root,
or one of the intermediate DNS servers to create a fake entry.
The second is to either remove the DigiPwntar root from his browser,
or pin the email server's private certificate. Then Chromium will not
accept this as a valid cert.
