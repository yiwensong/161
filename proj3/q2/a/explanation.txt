a) To obtain the secret, first I added the private key
   into the Wireshark RSA key list using the protocols interface.
   Following that, I opened the packet capture file and loaded it,
   and looked for the HTTP response from the server. The secret
   was located in this frame.
b) The cryptographic algorithms for this connection include:
   TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

   This includes RSA, AES-256 in Galois Counter Mode, and SHA384 MACs
c) The way to stop this kind of after-the-fact decryption, is to use
   ephemeral keys, such as ephemeral Diffie Hellman Key Exchange.
   Using this method, the keys are discarded after the connection,
   so we cannot decrypt the data after.
